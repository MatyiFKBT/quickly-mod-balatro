# How to mod Balatro quickly and easily?

> [!WARNING]

This repository meant to be a simple guide on how to mod Balatro. This guide will be updated as the game and modding tools evolve.

```sh
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matyifkbt/quickly-mod-balatro/master/setup.ps1 | iex
```

## Background

I wanted to create a simple script that would allow me to easily install Lovely and Steamodded in order to mod the game, but I ended up creating a full-fledged tool that can be used to install some of my used mods too. I hope other modders will find it useful.

## Mods included

These mods can be installed/upgraded using the script:

| Mod                           | Description                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| DorkDad141/keyboard-shortcuts | Many useful keyboard shortcuts          |
| nh6574/JokerDisplay           | Display useful information about Jokers |
